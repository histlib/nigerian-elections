On March 14, 2015, I started collecting tweets related to the upcoming Nigerian elections (to be held on March 28, 2015). Using Ed Summers' [twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc), I am archiving [#NigeriaDecides](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NigeriaDecides) tweets and [#iWillVoteAPC](https://twitter.com/search?q=iWillVoteAPC) tweets. Because of Twitter [policies](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy), I will not be sharing all of the raw data here.
